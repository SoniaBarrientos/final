####STATISTICS AND TIME-SERIES INTERACTIVES

> "In short, we're tasked with transforming data into directives. Good analysis parses numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization. We "humanize" the data by turning raw numbers into a story about our performance." ~ J. Bladt + B. Filbin

This week kicks off our visualization series, we'll be exploring data sets for time-series interactives and statistical charts/graphs.

**Interactive to Inspire**:

####PRACTICE
[C3.JS](http://c3js.org/) is a reusable chart library based on D3. Take a look at [the code for this Timeseries Chart](http://c3js.org/samples/timeseries.html) and think about how you could modify it to accommodate data of your choice.

Try to do that and integrate your practice into the assignment below (add it to you bl.ocks account if you can!).

Here is [an example using C3.JS for a categorical bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser/6236a61e5383ab0bc71d). If you feel like this is more relevant to your dataset, you can use that template too.
