<p>Turns out that roosters are the most popular animals to on illegally in the city with roosters accounting for a large majority of 311 complaints, particularly in the Bronx. To find this data i looked at NYC.gov's list of 311 complaints from 2010 to 2015. While there are a large range of complaints, from graffiti to noise, but what I found interesting was how many complaints there were about illegal animals kept as pets. I isolated the data to 3 major locations: Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, as these are the most populated and would have the most data to mine from. </p>
