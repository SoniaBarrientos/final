###Mapping Illegal Animals 
In the directory of 311 calls across New York City. there are many issues that warrant calls -- however the one tha tcaught my eye was the various reports of Illegal Aminals Kept as Pets. 

Since this topic relates directly to New York City laws, I decided to use a map to illustrate the density of animals in each area and color coded wach category of animal. 

One thing that I did not realize when looking at this was that roosters are arugablely the most popular animals to be illegally kept and that the Bronx and Brooklyn are the most popoulous.  

In order to find this data, I mined the 311 calls from 2010-2013 nand separated the animals ones from the other complaints.
